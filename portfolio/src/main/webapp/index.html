                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm Tanya. 
                    I'm pursuing my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Techology, Guwahati. 
                    Things that interest me the most are music, coding, working out, novels, astrophysics and a starry night sky! 
                    Also, I love having conversation with all kinds of people and gain experience from them.
                    <br/>
                    Recently, I've developed an interest for coding and both the thrill of speed and the patience required for diving deep into problems excite me!
                    I've also worked on various software projects both during my college and my internships and I've worked hard to learn to write good quality code.
                    Feel free to reach out to me anywhere and I'd love to talk to you :)
