                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Tanya. 
                I'm pursuing my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institure of Techology, Guwahati. 
                Things that interest me the most are music, working out, novels, astrophysics and a starry night sky! 
                Also, I love having conversation with all kinds of people and I've been told that I can really engage with a lot of people. 
                Recently, I've developed an interest for coding and it's the deep thinking part of it which excites me the most. 
                Feel free to reach out to me anywhere and I'd love to talk to you :)
