                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi! I'm Tanya. 
                I'm pursuing my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institure of Techology, Guwahati. 
                Things that interest me the most are music, working out, novels, astrophysics and a starry night sky! 
                Also, I love having conversation with all kinds of people and I've been told that I can really engage with a lot of people. 
                Recently, I've developed an interest for coding and it's the deep thinking part of it which excites me the most. 
                Feel free to reach out to me anywhere and I'd love to talk to you :)
                </p>

                            <h3>Socket Programming: Base-64 Encoding System</h3>
                            <p>Developed a Base64 Encoding Communication Protocol between server and client to communicate with each other based on TCP Sockets. 
                                Implemented a concurrent server to accept connections from multiple clients and serve all of them concurrently. 
                                The client and server interact using three types of messages: Type 1(Encoded text message), Type 2(ACK message), Type 3(Connection Termination message)

                        <h3>Accelerated Residual Descent Method</h3>
                        <p>Built a neural network optimization algorithm by modifying Nesterov's library.
                            Implemented Accelerated Residual Method which improves upon time complexity and
                            convergence rate of Conjugate Gradient Method and Nesterov's algorithm for dense matrices.
                            Introduction of residual descent restarting technique and incorporating preconditioning
                            techniques to accelerate its convergence.

                        <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
                        <p>Developed a Modern Employee Intranet app on Microsoft Teams, to host all features and needs
                            for any organisation on a single platform. Implemented command-based intelligent bots to identify, understand and proactively reply using rich cards, message extension to query through content, and task modules to create a modal popup experience.
                            The app was created on C# and .NET, used cognitive services like LUIS to develop an NLP based bot.

                    <h2>My photography skills!!</h2>
                    <p>I'm not a very photogenic person and on top of that I am camera conscious :(
                        So, the only selfies I ever take of myself are those weird, scary ones. 
                        Besides taking my selfies, I love capturing the nature. 
                        And this love has only grown ever since I joined my college with one of the most beautiful campuses in the country!!
                        I absolutely adore capturing the lovely, colourful flowers in the spring and lakes and ducks and swans and ofcourse the sky :)
                        So, my photo gallery would be full of sunsets, rain, swans and flowers. And ofcourse, I'll throw in some of my weird selfies too!
